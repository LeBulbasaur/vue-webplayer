# Webplayer client
This is the main part of my online music player made with the VueJS framework. To use it you need to run a server, which I added in a different repo.
I'm not gonna lie, code is a little messy, but everybody has to start somewhere.

## Project setup

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```

```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```

```

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
